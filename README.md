Business analytics case study analysing residential energy consumption to support renewable energy strategy and demand forecasting
# Energy Consumption Analytics for Renewable Energy Strategy
## Business Context
Renewable energy providers face increasing pressure to forecast demand accurately,
manage peak loads, and encourage greater adoption of renewable energy sources.

This analysis examines residential energy consumption patterns to identify demand
drivers and highlight opportunities where data-driven insights can support renewable
energy strategy and operational planning.
## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyse residential energy consumption patterns
- Identify differences in usage across time and day type
- Estimate the impact of temperature on energy demand using a regression model
- Highlight implications for renewable energy adoption and demand forecasting
## Data
The analysis uses a publicly available residential energy consumption dataset
covering approximately 1,000 households.

The dataset includes:
- Time-stamped energy consumption
- Renewable energy usage
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity)
- Contextual indicators (day type, peak vs off-peak periods)

The data represents a short time window (January–February) and is used to
explore consumption patterns rather than long-term seasonality.
